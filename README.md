👋 Hello! I'm Miguel M., a cybersecurity practicioner expanding my skillset into the realms of C, Python, Assembly, and Arduino. 

🛡️ My GitHub is a reflection of my journey to bridge the gap between cybersecurity and low-level programming/hardware prototyping. Here, you'll find projects showcasing my exploration of these areas and how they intersect with security.

🌱 I'm always eager to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of cybersecurity and explore innovative solutions. Let's connect and build a more secure future together!

⚡ Fun fact: When I'm not dissecting code or hardware, you can find me immersed in the Star Wars universe or quoting lines from "The Office." 

May the Force (and secure code) be with you! 🚀
